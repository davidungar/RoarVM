/**
 * Naming conventions
 *
 *  files   - names are lower-case, words are separated by underscores
 *          - names of Squeak-related files like RVMPlugin keep their
 *            Squeak-like naming scheme
 *
 *  classes - words start with a capital letter
 *          - words are separated by an underscore
 *          - abbreviations are completely capitalized
 *          - Oop isn't an abbreviation of object-oriented pointer ;)
